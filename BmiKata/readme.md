# BMI

Write a console app that calculates a user’s Body Mass Index (BMI):

1) Prompt the user for their `height` in meters and `weight` in kilograms.
2) Calculate the BMI as `weight / height^2^`.
3) Output a message: `underweight` (BMI < 18.5), `overweight` (BMI >= 25), or `healthy`.
4) Structure your code so that pure and impure parts are separate.
5) Unit test the pure parts.
6) Unit test the overall workflow using the function-based approach to abstract away the reading from and writing to the console.
